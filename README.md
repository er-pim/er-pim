- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @er-pim (Erin).
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m an incoming PhD student at Caltech and I am interested in planetary surface processes and the techniques that are used to study planetary surfaces.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Python as a geoscience tool. I am generally interested in how we use data science to advance solutions to geoscience questions on Earth and other planets!
